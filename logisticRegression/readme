"While Naive Bayes struggled due to the high correlation between medical features (violating its independence assumption), Logistic Regression handled the multi-collinearity better through feature scaling and weighted coefficients. The most significant finding is the 18% jump in Recall for readmitted patients (Class 1). In a hospital setting, this means the Logistic Regression model is nearly twice as effective at flagging high-risk patients for intervention than the baseline model."
