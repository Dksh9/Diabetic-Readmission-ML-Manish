## 🧠 Why Random Forest Won


Unlike simpler models, the Random Forest utilizes an **Ensemble Learning** strategy. By aggregating the predictions of 200 individual decision trees, it successfully reduced the "noise" found in clinical datasets. 
* **Handling Class Imbalance:** Used `class_weight='balanced'` to ensure the model didn't ignore the minority "Readmitted" group.
* **Feature Interaction:** It effectively captured non-linear relationships between variables (e.g., the relationship between `time_in_hospital` and `num_lab_procedures`).

## 🔬 Clinical Impact & Conclusion
The primary goal was to maximize **Recall** for the "Readmitted" class. A model with high recall ensures that hospitals can intervene *before* discharge for patients most at risk. 

By increasing recall from **0.23 (Naive Bayes)** to **0.58 (Random Forest)**, this project demonstrates how selecting the appropriate architecture can nearly triple the effectiveness of a clinical screening tool.

📝 Self-Reflection & Critical Analysis

This project served as an end-to-end exploration of the machine learning pipeline, from raw clinical data to an optimized ensemble model. A critical learning point was the realization that Accuracy is a deceptive metric in healthcare datasets; if I had relied on Accuracy alone, the Naive Bayes model might have seemed 'passable' despite missing 77% of at-risk patients. Moving forward, the project highlights the importance of Feature Engineering. While the Random Forest performed well, further refinement of the 'Diagnostic' codes into broader categories (e.g., grouping ICD-9 codes by organ system) could potentially reduce the high dimensionality that hindered the k-Nearest Neighbors model. Ultimately, the transition from linear baselines to ensemble methods demonstrated that the complexity of the model must match the complexity of the underlying biological and clinical processes.
